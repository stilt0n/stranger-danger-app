# Todos

- Organize todos somewhere besides a markdown file
- Allow message editing
- Handle whitespace in messages
- Sanitize messages
- Store message history?
  - Seems unnecessary for an app for talking to strangers
  - For long conversations may be a good way to prevent lag from long chat history.
  - I'm not 100% I actually want this to be chat for strangers
